## 💾 Setting Up Your LoveByte SD Card: Give Her a Little Space to Shine! ✨

Every diva needs her own closet—and LoveByte is no different! Your microSD card is where she keeps all her precious files, memories, and that dazzling splash screen when she powers up.

### 🛍️ What Goes Where?

After you’ve got your microSD card (any size is fine—LoveByte isn’t greedy!), you’ll want to make sure it’s set up just right:

- **images/** — This is where LoveByte saves and finds her received pictures and GIFs.
- **messages/** — All your sweet messages, perfectly organized and saved.
- **res/** — Special things live here, like her stylish **splash.jpg** (that cute logo you see at startup).

### 🎀 Step-by-Step Setup:

1. **Format your microSD card** (FAT32 recommended—she likes things tidy!).
2. **Make these three folders** at the top level of the card:  
   - `images`
   - `messages`
   - `res`
3. **Add your splash screen**:  
   Place your custom `splash.jpg` into the `res` folder.  
   That’s the image LoveByte shows off when she boots up—so make it cute!

### 💡 Pro Tips

- Don’t worry about the image size—LoveByte will handle it!  
- Want to change the splash? Just swap out `splash.jpg` anytime.
- You can add, remove, or peek at images and messages anytime using the file manager in the web UI.

With your microSD card set up, LoveByte has everything she needs to keep your memories safe and start every day with a little extra sparkle. 🌟
