## 🌟 Server Setup: Open Your Heart (and Port 6969!) 🌟

**Ready to host your own LoveByte party?** Here’s how to get your LoveByte server up and running, and make sure your devices can talk to each other without a hitch!

### 1. Install Python (if you don’t have it yet)
Download [Python 3](https://python.org/) and install it—easy peasy!

### 2. Run the LoveByte Server
Just open a terminal (or command prompt), go to your LoveByte server folder, and run:

    python lovebyte_server.py

This launches your server, and it will automatically set up everything it needs (even the cute dependencies).

### 3. Open Port 6969 (The Magic Portal!)

For your LoveByte devices to connect, you need to let them through your computer’s firewall—right through port **6969** (so memorable and a little cheeky).

**On Windows:**
- Open the Start menu and type **“Windows Defender Firewall”**.
- Click “Advanced settings”.
- In “Inbound Rules”, click “New Rule…”.
- Select “Port”, click Next.
- Choose “TCP”, enter `6969`, click Next.
- Allow the connection, click Next.
- Name it something fabulous, like “LoveByte Magic Port”.
- Click Finish. Yay!

**On MacOS:**
- Go to System Settings → Network → Firewall.
- Add a new rule to allow incoming connections for Python (or Terminal) on port 6969.

**On Linux:**

    sudo ufw allow 6969/tcp

(or use your system’s firewall tool)

### 4. Find Your Server’s IP Address
Your LoveByte devices need the server’s IP address!

- On Windows: Type `ipconfig` in Command Prompt.
- On Mac/Linux: Type `ifconfig` or `ip a` in Terminal.
- Look for your local network IP (like `192.168.x.x`).

### 5. Set the Server Address on Your LoveByte Devices
- Go to your LoveByte web UI (`/config` or `/lb/cloud`) and enter your server’s IP (without the `http://` part), then save.

### 6. Ready, Set, Sparkle!
Now all your LoveByte devices can send and receive messages, pics, and good vibes! If you ever need to add more friends, just repeat these steps. 💖

If you get stuck, don’t worry—LoveByte is all about bringing a little more joy (and pink) to your tech life. Let the love flow!
